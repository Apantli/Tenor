# AI Features

Tenor includes powerful AI capabilities to streamline project management and boost team productivity. This guide explains the available AI features and how to use them effectively.

## AI-Assisted Generation

Tenor leverages AI to help you generate various types of content:

### Task Generation

Automatically generate tasks for user stories and issues:

1. Navigate to a user story or issue detail view
2. Click on the "Generate Tasks" button in the tasks section
3. Specify the number of tasks to generate (1-5)
4. Optionally, provide a specific prompt to guide the AI
5. Review the generated tasks in the preview section
6. Accept or reject each task individually, or use the "Accept All" button
7. Edit accepted tasks as needed after generation

The AI analyzes the user story or issue description to create relevant, actionable tasks.

### User Story Generation

Create user stories based on project context and requirements:

1. Navigate to the User Stories tab
2. Click on the "Generate User Stories" button
3. Specify the number of user stories to generate
4. Provide optional prompting for specific types of user stories
5. Review, accept, or reject the generated content

### Issue Generation

Generate potential issues that might arise in your project:

1. Go to the Issues tab
2. Click on the "Generate Issues" button
3. Specify generation parameters
4. Review and refine the AI suggestions

## AI Context Configuration

Tenor's AI works best with project context, which you can configure:

1. Navigate to Project Settings > AI
2. Add a project description to help the AI understand your project domain
3. Upload context files (requirements documents, specifications, etc.)
4. Add context links to relevant resources
5. Save your changes

Better context leads to more accurate and relevant AI-generated content.

## AI Prompting Tips

To get the most out of Tenor's AI features:

- **Be specific**: Clearly state what you want the AI to generate
- **Provide context**: Include relevant details in your prompts
- **Use consistent terminology**: Match the terms used in your project
- **Set expectations**: Specify the level of detail you want
- **Iterate**: Use the AI output as a starting point and refine as needed

## Implementation Details

Tenor's AI features are implemented using:

- Large Language Models for content generation
- Context-aware prompting with project-specific data
- Structured output formatting for different item types

## Privacy and Data Usage

Tenor's AI features are designed with privacy in mind:

- Your project data is processed securely
- Project context is used only for generating content for your project
- No project data is saved or used to train the underlying models

## Limitations

Current limitations of the AI features:

- Generation works best with clear, detailed project descriptions
- Complex technical details may need human refinement
- AI suggestions should always be reviewed by the team
- Generation quality depends on the quality of project context provided
