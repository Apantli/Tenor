# Tenor Architecture

This document provides an overview of Tenor's architectural design and technical implementation.

## System Architecture

Tenor follows a modern web application architecture with a React-based frontend and Firebase backend:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Client (Next.js)│ ←→  │    Firebase    │ ←→  │  External APIs  │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### Frontend Architecture

Tenor's frontend is built using Next.js with TypeScript, providing both server-side rendering and client-side interactivity:

- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript

- **API Communication**: tRPC
- **Component Structure**: Modular components organized by feature

### Backend Architecture

Tenor leverages Firebase for its backend services:

- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions (when needed)
- **API Layer**: tRPC for type-safe API endpoints

## Core Modules

Tenor is organized into several key modules:

### Project Management
- Project creation and configuration
- Team and user management
- Project settings

### Backlog Management
- User stories
- Issues
- Requirements
- Tags and categorization

### Sprint Planning
- Sprint creation and planning
- Backlog item assignment
- Sprint duration configuration

### Task Management
- Task creation and assignment
- Status tracking
- Priority management

### Scrum Board
- Kanban-style board visualization
- Task status columns
- Drag-and-drop functionality

### Performance Analytics
- Sprint performance metrics
- Team velocity tracking
- Burndown charts

## Data Model

Tenor's core data entities include:

### User
- Profile information
- Authentication details
- Roles and permissions

### Project
- Project metadata
- Team members

- **Viewer**: Read-only access

Each role has configurable permissions for different project areas such as backlog, sprints, settings, etc.

## Deployment Architecture

Tenor is designed for cloud deployment:

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Firebase services
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
