          <strong>Your Privacy Matters</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use <em>Conversation Mode</em>, your voice and biometric data
          are processed securely. We do <strong>not</strong> store your raw
          voice recordings or biometric data directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, your voice data is first converted to text using
          speech-to-text technology. Only the resulting text and analysis are
          storedâ€”never the original audio. Similarly, biometric data is
          analyzed, and only the results of that analysis are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Your raw voice and biometric data remain private and are never
            accessible to anyone but you.
          </strong>{" "}
          No one else, including our team, can access your original data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your data is
          handled responsibly.
